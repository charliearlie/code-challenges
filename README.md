# Coding challenges

I regularly complete coding challenges online to try and improve my logical thinking and problem solving.
This is the solutions to those challenges, as well as the description of the task if you want to attempt it first.

I will not include premium challenges from certain websites as of course they are behind paywalls and would be unfair of me to display the challenges here.
